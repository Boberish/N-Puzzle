# N-Puzzle

This is a puzzle solver. You can run the main.py for the command line interface,

It has a GUI if you launch the displayResult.py
(note this is a quick mock-up, many things to add/fix on GUI)

When solving remember some heruisics are very slow and could take a very long time.
 manhattan + LC will be quite fast with perfect solution.
 super fast will solve very quick, but possible with more steps than required.
 
 doing 4x4 or 5x5 without a good heuristic could take minutes-hours.
